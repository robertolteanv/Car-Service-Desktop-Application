# Car Service Desktop Application
“Vericu Service and tuning” is a desktop application that eases communication between
customers and the mechanics of a car service. The application has two types of users:
customers and mechanics. The application allows customers to see the status of their car’s
visit to the shop, as well as contact information of the service. Respectively, the mechanics
can add a car by introducing the basic information of a car and after that he can change the
status of the appointment or delete the car from the database. The application has been
developed in JavaFX and the database controller PostgreSQL.
